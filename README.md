# Environmental and Housing Factors Associated with Adult Asthma Outcomes Across Bronx Neighborhoods

## Project Background 
Adult asthma remains a significant public health concern in urban communities, where environmental exposures and housing conditions may contribute to poor respiratory outcomes. This project analyzes neighborhood-level adult asthma hospitalization rates across Bronx neighborhoods to understand whether air pollution patterns and housing maintenance conditions are associated with higher asthma burden. The goal is to identify localized disparities that may inform targeted public health interventions rather than borough-wide approaches.

### Success Metrics & Evaluation 

#### Primary Health Outcomes:

✓ Reduce asthma hospitalization rates by 25% in priority zones within 3 years

✓ Decrease emergency department visits by 30%

✓ Improve asthma control among 80% of program participants

#### Environmental & Housing Targets: 

✓ Reduce PM2.5 by 0.5-1.0 μg/m³ in highest-pollution neighborhoods

✓ Remediate 100% of identified housing violations within 18 months

✓ Achieve 90% compliance rate on new housing inspections

**Accountability Mechanism:** Publish quarterly public dashboards tracking all metrics by neighborhood. Convene community review sessions every 6 months. Adjust strategies based on data-driven evaluation.

### Data Structure Overview

**Asthma Hospitalization Rates:** Age-adjusted adult (18+) asthma hospitalizations per 10,000 residents, averaged across multiple reporting periods from NYC Environment & Health Data Portal

**Air Quality (PM2.5):** Annual average fine particulate matter concentration in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³), measured through NYC air monitoring network

**Housing Violations:** Count of maintenance code violations in Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) related to building conditions affecting respiratory health, including ventilation deficiencies, moisture problems, and pest control failures

### Executive Summary

#### Overview of Findings
This analysis finds that adult asthma hospitalization rates are unevenly distributed across Bronx neighborhoods, with a small subset experiencing significantly higher burden. Neighborhoods with elevated air pollution levels and poorer housing maintenance conditions tend to show higher asthma hospitalization rates. These patterns suggest that asthma risk is shaped by localized environmental and housing factors rather than borough-wide trends. The findings support the need for neighborhood-targeted public health and housing interventions.

#### Insights Deep Dive
**Severe Health Disparities:** Hunts Point - Mott Haven experiences adult asthma hospitalization rates of 60.6 per 10,000 residents—nearly four times higher than lower-risk Bronx neighborhoods. This represents a critical environmental justice issue requiring immediate intervention.

**Air Quality Connection:** All high-burden neighborhoods show PM2.5 levels above 9.0 μg/m³. High Bridge - Morrisania has the highest PM2.5 at 9.5 μg/m³, correlating with a hospitalization rate of 50.7 per 10,000. Reducing air pollution in these areas is an urgent public health priority.

**Housing Infrastructure Crisis:** Crotona - Tremont neighborhoods collectively have 104 housing violations affecting respiratory conditions. These violations—including inadequate ventilation, moisture problems, and pest control failures—compound outdoor air quality issues and create dangerous indoor environments.

**Geographic Concentration:** Three neighborhood clusters (Hunts Point - Mott Haven, High Bridge - Morrisania, Crotona - Tremont) account for the majority of asthma burden. Targeted investment in air quality monitoring, housing remediation, and healthcare access in these areas would yield the greatest population health impact.

## Recommendations
- **Public Health Agencies:** Convene Bronx Asthma Task Force within 30 days
- **Housing Officials:** Prioritize inspection and remediation resources to 104 violations in Crotona - Tremont
- **Environmental Protection:** Deploy mobile PM2.5 monitoring in top 3 priority zones
- **Community Organizations:** Mobilize residents for tenant rights education and advocacy
- **Healthcare Providers:** Expand asthma care coordination and medication access programs
